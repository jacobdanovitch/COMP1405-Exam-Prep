# 4.1 Function Variables and Scope

While there is no syntax error, it is somewhat pointless to change the variable passed into the function as a parameter at the start of the function. Whatever parameter the functions are currently called with will immediately be locally overwritten with 2 and 5. The functions could just be called with `func1(5)` and `func2(2)`.
