# 2.1 Tracing the Output

1. The output will be as follows:
  ```python
  >>>25
  >>>True
  ```
  
2. The code will not execute because the if statements are using a single `=` sign instead of `==`. As well, the code could be written much more efficiently:
  ```python
  if 1 <= a <= 3:
    print("You selected "+str(a)+"!")
  else:
    print("You entered an invalid value!")
  ```
