# 7.1 What is Recursion

The basic definition of recursion is a function calling itself inside its own definition. 
A recursive function is broken down into 2 parts: the **Base Case** and the **Recursive Case**.  

Each iteration through a recursive function will check the base case _first_ (it is important that it does so first), and if that is not satisfied will default to the recursive case, calling the function again for the next, lower (or higher, in some cases) iteration. 
This is highlighted through functions such as the _Fibonacci_ or _Factorial_ functions' recursive implementations. 

```python
#Recursive Factorial Function

def Factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1 #Base case
    else:
        return n*Factorial(n-1) #Recursive case
```

## 

Some questions to think about:
- Why do we call Factorial(n-1)? Why don't we call Factorial(n)?
- Can any recursive function can be rewritten with a while loop?
- Can any while loop be rewritten with a recursive function?
