# COMP1405 Exam Prep

In this repository are the completed answers for all of Kevin's practice problems to review for the exam. If you notice any errors, feel free to message me to get them corrected. Due to the size of this review, I wasn't able to comment all of the code involved - hopefully it mostly all makes sense.

The written questions are in .MD files, and the coding ones are in .py files. They are named corresponding to Kevin's document. As well, I've included a few "bonus" examples for some of the more difficult concepts. 

```python
print('Happy studying!')
```
