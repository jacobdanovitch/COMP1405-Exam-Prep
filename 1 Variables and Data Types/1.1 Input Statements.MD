# 1.1 Input Statements

1. The first print statement outputs whatever the user enters.
2. The intended result was to print the inputted age multiplied by 2, but it is not working correctly.  Currently it will print the age entered twice. I.e.:
  ```python
  inputVar = '40'
  >>>'40'
  >>>'4040'
  ```
     
3. To fix it, we need to cast the input to an integer.  This can be done by changing the first line to: inputVar = int(input(“...”))
