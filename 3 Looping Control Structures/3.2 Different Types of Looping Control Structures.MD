# 3.2 Different Types of Looping Control Structures

## For Loops

The **for loop** should be used when there is a _predetermined, finite number of repetitions_, ie you know how many times you want it to loop ahead of time.
  - Example: Say you'd like to compute a class' average mark for a course. There's a known, finite number of students in the course - so, you use a for loop.
  - Try to implement this! You can get a list of marks by running this code. To change the class size, change the 150 to the size you want. 
    ```python
    from random import choice
    class_marks = [choice(range(101)) for _ in range(150)]
    ```

## While Loops

The **while loop** should be used when there is an _unknown or arbitrarily large_ number of repetitions necessary, and instead you want the loop to run until a condition is met.
  - Example: Say you'd like the user to guess a random number between 0 and 100. This might take a lot of guesses! We don't know how many it will take - so we use a while loop.
  - Try to implement this! You can get a random number with this code:
    ```python
    from random import choice
    number_for_guessing = choice(range(101))
    ```

Some questions to think about:

- Can any **for loop** be rewritten as a **while loop**?
- Can any **while loop** be rewritten as a **for loop**?
