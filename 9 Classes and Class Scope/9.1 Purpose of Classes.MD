# 9.1 Purpose of Classes

A **class** is a convenient way of organizing a set of attributes (variables) and actions (methods) into a single framework that can be interacted with and stored.  We usually create classes for _objects_, some generic, noun-like entity. These objects all share common attributes and actions. 

For example, you might create a class for an animal. All animals have certain attributes (species, height, weight), and certain actions (eat, play).

The benefits of using classes mostly involve saving lots of time and repeated code. Rather than writing something like:
```python
animal_one_species = "zebra"
animal_one_height = "tall"
animal_one_weight = "medium"
...
```

We'll be able to write something more like:
```python
zebra = Animal("zebra","tall","medium")
```

Which lets us create lots of animals in a short amount of time:
```python
zebra = Animal("zebra","tall","medium")
elephant = Animals("elephant","tall","heavy")
tiger = Animals("tiger","medium","medium")
```

Classes generally have, aside from any other specific methods you'd like to create, _getter_ and _setter_ methods. These, intuitively, either _get_ or _set_ some attribute. So, if we wanted to know our tiger's weight:
```python
print(tiger.getWeight())
```
And if we decided that it needed to go on a bit of a diet:
```python
tiger.setWeight("light")
```

## 

Some questions to think about:
- We created an animal object. If we were to make it more specific - such as a fish object - how would it be different? Would it keep the same methods and attributes as the animal object? Would it add more? 
- Could we get even more specific than fish?
